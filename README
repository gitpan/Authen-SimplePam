Authen/SimplePam
================

Authen::SimplePAM simplifies the use of PAM
to authenticate users, so that there is no need to 
know how PAM really works.

Refer to the pod documentation

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Note that make test won't work.

PROGRAMS

There are a few scripts in the bin/ dir.
They are simple programs that might be a start point on
how to use Authen::SimplePam.

auth_user.pl - authenticates a user.
               checks if the user password is correct.

change_password.pl - change a user's password.
                     probably will only work as root.

chngpwd - an script to change a user password.
          this script needs to be run suid.
          It was written to let a non-root user change
          any user password as long as he knows the current
          password.
          A directly use for it is as a tool to be used from
          a CGI script to change a user password thru web.
          I tryed to make it as secure as possible, however
          I do not garantee anything.
